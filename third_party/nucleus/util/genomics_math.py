"""Mathematics functions.

A quick note on terminology here.

There are a bunch kinds of probabilities used commonly in genomics:

-- pError: the probability of being wrong.
-- pTrue: the probability of being correct.

Normalized probabilities vs. unnormalized likelihoods:

-- Normalized probabilities: p_1, ..., p_n such that sum(p_i) == 1 are said
   said to be normalized because they represent a valid probability
   distribution over the states 1 ... n.
-- Unnormalized likelihoods: p_1, ..., p_n where sum(p_i) != 1. These are not
   normalized and so aren't a valid probabilities distribution.

To add even more complexity, probabilities are often represented in three
semi-equivalent spaces:

-- Real-space: the classic space, with values ranging from [0.0, 1.0]
   inclusive.
-- log10-space: If p is the real-space value, in log10-space this would be
   represented as log10(p). How the p == 0 case is handled is often function
   dependent, which may accept/return -Inf or not handle the case entirely.
-- Phred-scaled: See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phred_quality_score for
   more information. But briefly, the Phred-scale maintains resolution in the
   lower parts of the probability space using integer quality scores (though
   using ints is optional, really). The phred-scale is defined as

     `phred(p) = -10 * log10(p)`

   where p is a real-space probability.

The code in math.h dealing with probabilities is very explicit about what
kind probability and representation is expects and returns, as unfortunately
these are all represented commonly as doubles in C++. Though tempting to
address this issue with classic software engineering practices like creating
a Probability class, in practice this is extremely difficult to do as this
code is often performance critical and the low-level mathematical operations
used in this code (e.g., log10) don't distiguish themselves among the types
of probabilities.

  This function normalizes log10 probabilities. What this means is that we
  return an equivalent array of probabilities but whereas sum(10^log10_probs) is
  not necessarily 1.0, the resulting array is sum(10^result) ~= 1.0. The ~=
  indicates that the result is not necessarily == 1.0 but very close.

  This function is a fast and robust approximation of the true normalization of
  a log10 transformed probability vector. To understand the approximation,
  let's start with the exact calculation. Suppose I have three models, each
  emitting a probability that some data was generated by that model:

    data = {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} => probabilities from models A, B, and C

  These probabilities are unnormalized, in the sense that the total probability
  over the vector doesn't sum to 1 (sum(data) = 0.111). In many applications we
  want to normalize this vector so that sum(normalized(data)) = 1 and the
  relative magnitudes of the original probabilities are preserved (i.e,:

    data[i] / data[j] = normalized(data)[i] / normalized(data)[j]

  for all pairs of values indexed by i and j. For much of the work we do in
  genomics, we have so much data that representing these raw probability
  vectors in real-space risks numeric underflow/overflow, so we instead
  represent our probability vectors in log10 space:

    log10_data = log10(data) = {-1, -2, -3}

  Given that we expect numeric problems in real-space, normalizing this log10
  vector is hard, because the standard way you'd do the normalization is via:

    data[i] = data[i] / sum(data)
    log10_data[i] = log10_data[i] - log10(sum(10^data))

  But computing the sum of log10 values this way is dangerous because the naive
  implementation converts back to real-space to do the sum, the very operation
  we're trying to avoid due to numeric instability.

  This function implements an approximate normalization, which relaxes the need
  for an exact calculation of the sum. This function ensures that the
  normalization is numerically safe at the expense of the sum not being exactly
  equal to 1 but rather just close.

  Args:
    log10_probs: array-like of floats. An array of log10 probabilties.

  Returns:
    np.array with the same shape as log10_probs but where sum(10^result) ~= 1.0.
